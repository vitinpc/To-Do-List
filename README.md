📌 To-Do List API – Task Management

The To-Do List API is a REST application developed to facilitate the management of daily tasks.

With it, it is possible to create, list, update, and delete tasks, as well as control status, priorities, and important dates.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate the implementation of a REST API integrated with a relational database, applying best practices in development, layered organization, and data validation.
